# jladown

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of jladown is to provide a reproducible template for the Journal of Learning Analytics using R Markdown in multiple formats such as pdf, gitbook, and Word.

## Installation

`jladown` is currently under development on GitHub. Please install and test the package as follows:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
if(!require(remotes)) {
install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github('jooyoungseo/jladown')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use `jladown` package. While 
other formats are usable, `pdf` output is fully supported at this moment.

### Loading package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(jladown)
```

### For non-RStudio users

For non-RStudio users, you may create a project template in the current path 
with the following function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jladown:::jladown_skeleton('.')
```

### For RStudio users

For RStudio users, as long as `jladown` is installed, you can create a project 
by creating a new R Markdown Document. From within RStudio, select "File" -> 
"New File" -> "R Markdown", and then select the *Journal of Learning Analytics* 
(`jladown) template, as in the below image.

## Using the template

We provide an overview of using the template here; see the template for more 
specific details.

### Front matter

First, edit the following key fields in the front-matter (which is 
in the [YAML format](https://yaml.org/):

- Title
- Author
- Affiliation
- Keywords
- Abstract

<!-- I'm not sure that the next line is true, and so I commented it out for now: -->

<!-- We note that fields that are not edited will not be included in the rendered -->
<!-- document. -->

### Body

Edit the body as you would any document. The `#` symbol represents a header; 
additional `#` symbols represent different levels of headers, as follows:

- `#`: Level-1 header
- `##`: Level-2 header
- `###`: Level-3 header
- `####`: Level-4 header

Text can be italicized using the `*` symbol, as with the following text:
*emphasized statement*.

Code can be included with 
[R Markdown code chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html); 
images not generated from code in these chunks can be included in a chunk via 
the function `knitr::include_graphics()`.

### References

References can be included in [BibTeX format]
(http://www.bibtex.org/) using [the apacite format]
(http://ctan.uniminuto.edu/biblio/bibtex/contrib/apacite/apacite.pdf)

# To-Do List

- [x] Add auto-word-counting capability using `rmdfiltr` package internally.
- [ ] Fix `template.docx` does not take any effect on `jladown::jla_word()` output.
- [ ] Make a cover page including jla logo for `bookdown::gitbook()` output.
